# student-web
We want to create a student-focused website where there’s a main forum for discussions, with official and legit information shared only by authorized users and moderators. The site will have different sections for each semester with notes, PYQs, and all study materials. There will also be a section for internships and opportunities, a space for students to showcase their extracurricular activities, and a feature where students can share ideas and form groups to work on them. A login system will be included so we know who’s using the platform. All user credentials and content will be stored securely using scalable storage, and we’ll also have a live chat feature for real-time help and discussions.
